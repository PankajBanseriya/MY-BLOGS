                <h3>Delhi - A City of Contrasts</h3>
                <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/zD3r0xiBfeIZ5jFb8t9dIhb1fjERJJiaY3hcW3Nu4-Q/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly90NC5m/dGNkbi5uZXQvanBn/LzAyLzM1LzYyLzgx/LzM2MF9GXzIzNTYy/ODExNl90MXFWWXQ4/T1BrUEFPZzBBYWlC/YkJRSGtvcGFtekRM/ai5qcGc" alt="delhi city" height="250px">
                <P>
                    My journey began in the vibrant capital city of Delhi. The juxtaposition of ancient history and modernity is striking. The historic Red Fort and Jama Masjid stand as testimony to the city's Mughal past, while the bustling markets of Chandni Chowk showcase the energetic pulse of contemporary Delhi. Don't miss the delicious street food, a sensory delight for any food enthusiast.</P>

                    <h3>Jaipur - The Pink City</h3>
                    <img src='https://imgs.search.brave.com/Qz72pVDeK3hezx2r6WEayAMgA4LmdA09xvcvazViV3M/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9jZG4u/YXVkbGV5dHJhdmVs/LmNvbS83MDAvNTAx/Lzc5LzEzMjg0MTEt/aGF3YS1tYWhhbC1q/YWlwdXIuanBn' alt="jaipur" height="250px">
                    <p>
                        The Pink City of Jaipur is a feast for the eyes. The magnificent Hawa Mahal, City Palace, and Amber Fort narrate tales of royalty and grandeur. Walking through the narrow lanes of the old city, adorned with vibrant bazaars, is like stepping back in time. The intricate architecture and the warm hospitality of the locals make Jaipur a must-visit destination.</p>

                    <h3>Varanasi - Spiritual Serenity</h3>
                    <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/LZNpcn_9FrIAdX3ya-88YO_9QdlIvS-K4u6yYQEtAxA/rs:fit:500:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS5pc3RvY2twaG90/by5jb20vaWQvNTM3/OTg4MTY1L3Bob3Rv/L3ZhcmFuYXNpLmpw/Zz9zPTYxMng2MTIm/dz0wJms9MjAmYz1m/RnBFTDE3TWlRSng1/TmtrTklWclRzZXNk/MkU4YjA0U0Nnempm/aFVtUTdnPQ" alt="Varanasi" height="250px">
                    <p>

                        Varanasi, situated on the banks of the sacred Ganges River, is a city that exudes spirituality. The Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat is a mesmerizing spectacle that one must experience. Strolling along the ghats, observing the rituals, and taking a boat ride during sunrise are moments of tranquility that stay etched in memory.</p>

                    <h3>Kerala - God's Own Country</h3>
                    <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/QAwv9nVcQVWlYBn9wIOzZcZdE68Xbhlw8LDwnc6QA8M/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly90NC5m/dGNkbi5uZXQvanBn/LzAxLzA1LzEwLzc5/LzM2MF9GXzEwNTEw/Nzk1Nl90dHIxRkRT/QUpiaWZlSER3YnpS/TVNpWGwwMWxscXoy/YS5qcGc" alt="Kerela" height="250px">
                    <p>

                        Kerala, with its lush green landscapes and tranquil backwaters, is a haven for nature lovers. A houseboat cruise through the backwaters of Alleppey is a surreal experience. The aroma of spices in the air, the calming sound of water, and the vibrant cultural performances make Kerala a perfect destination to unwind and rejuvenate.</p>
